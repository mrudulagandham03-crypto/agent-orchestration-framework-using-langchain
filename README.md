# AGENT-ORCHESTRATION-FRAMEWORK-WITH-LANGCHAIN
Batch 6/7 
Agent-Orchestration Framework with LangChain
https://agent-orchestration-framework-with-phi.vercel.app/ - project live working link

This project focuses on building a multi-agent orchestration framework using the LangChain library. The system simulates intelligent, collaborative agents capable of planning tasks, managing memory, invoking tools, and coordinating to achieve a shared objective.
The goal is to automate moderately complex multi-step workflows using agent collaboration.


---

Project Statement

The framework enables:

Intelligent multi-agent systems

Task planning and execution

Tool integration for API calls and simulated data fetching

Memory-based reasoning (short-term + long-term)

Orchestrated communication between agents

REST API integration & optional frontend UI


This project provides hands-on experience with LLM-powered automation, agent-native architectures, and practical workflow design.

Outcomes

✔ Multi-agent LLM-powered system using LangChain

✔ Intelligent agents with planning & execution

✔ Custom tool integration

✔ Individual & shared memory mechanisms

✔ Multi-agent orchestration workflows

✔ REST API for workflow automation

✔ Optional frontend interface
